## Implement Lab Progress Persistence After Refresh 

### Feature Requirement
Implement lab persistence to retain the deployment progress state, ensuring it continues from the same point after a page refresh.

### Implementation
The deployment progress will no longer restart from 0% after a page refresh. It will continue from where it left off prior to the refresh.

### Steps for Testing the Lab Progress Persistence After Refresh: 

1. Log in to the CL portal and navigate to the required tenant (WIZ). On the left-hand side of the page, you will see the Template section.

2. Navigate to the **ODL (1)** section in the left menu and click on the **Users (2)** button.

7. As the lab is being deployed, you will see the duration and the percentage of the labâ€™s progress. Now, try clicking the Refresh button at the top left of the page and check the deployment status. It will continue from where it left off prior to the refresh.
